  SMA2 Plug v2
  ============

The SMA2 Plug is a small printed circuit board (PCB) which can
be used as an extension module to attach coaxial cables to
an FPGA board.

One side of the module has two SMA connectors which can be used
either as digital input or as digital output at TTL level.
The other side of the module has a 2x6 pin header for plugging
into an FPGA board, compatible with the Digilent Pmod specification.

For more details, see the user manual

The SMA2 Plug is an open hardware design. This repository contains
the complete KiCad design files and design documents for the module.
